# Retail Sales Analytics using SQL and Python

## Project Overview

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/najirh/Walmart_SQL_Python/blob/main/walmart_project-piplelines.png)

This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution developed to uncover business insights from Walmart retail sales data. I used Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy) for data preparation and cleaning, and SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) for advanced querying and business analysis. The goal was to design a structured workflow that processes raw datasets into actionable insights on sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior.

# My Approach

# Environment Setup

Configured VS Code with Python and SQL database connections (MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Organized project files and workflows for smooth development.

# Data Acquisition & Preparation

Pulled Walmart sales dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, corrected data types, formatted currency, and removed duplicates.

Engineered new features such as Total Transaction Value (unit_price * quantity) for better financial analysis.

# Database Integration

Loaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL & PostgreSQL using Pythonâ€™s SQLAlchemy.

Created relational tables and validated data through initial SQL queries.

# SQL Analysis & Business Problem Solving

Designed and executed advanced SQL queries (joins, CTEs, window functions, CASE statements) to address key business questions:

Which product categories and branches drive the highest revenue?

What are the busiest days/hours and seasonal demand patterns?

Which payment methods are most preferred by customers?

How do profit margins vary by branch and category?

# Documentation & Publishing

Documented queries, workflows, and insights in Markdown and Jupyter Notebook.

Published the project on GitHub with SQL scripts, Python notebooks, and a structured README.

# Key Results & Insights

Identified top-performing categories and branches contributing most to revenue.

Discovered customer buying patterns, such as peak hours and preferred payment methods.

Analyzed profitability trends across branches and product categories to support better decision-making.

# Future Scope

Enhance the analysis with Power BI/Tableau dashboards for interactive reporting.

Automate the data pipeline for real-time sales monitoring.

Extend to multi-source integration for deeper analytics.s business case studies on sales and supply chain optimization.
